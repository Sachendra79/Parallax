        <p class="text">
            Adventures are some of the moments in life, which makes our heart pump faster and gives us the feeling of being alive and full. It is an exciting experience very different from our normal daily routine. The adventure also brings with it a certain amount of risk. It brings thrill with it, and we can feel the wind rushing. Some people love adventures and live for them. Others use it as a means of escape from their normal lives. Whatever be the reason, adventure makes people feel great about being able to live those moments.
         <br> <br>
            Activities like horse riding, bungee jumping, river rafting, parasailing, skiing, kayaking, paragliding, mountain climbing, freefalls etc. are called adventure activities. All of these activities also have a risk factor, but that is what makes them exciting. Adventure activities must be done under expert supervision, which will keep you safe in case of any emergency situation. Everyone should indulge in some adventure activity in their lives because we only live once.

            <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>

         </div>
         <p class="text">
            Biking is known to benefit participants by increasing muscle strength and flexibility, endurance, and lung capacity. It helps in weight reduction, lowering blood pressure, and lowering the risk of depression, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Many people also find that bicycling can lower their transportation costs by minimizing the use of an automobile, while others enjoy the opportunities for slow-paced travel through national parks and other scenic areas afforded by cycling. Still others find that bicycling is a good way to bring family members or friends together for group outings.
             <br><br>
        Biking is a topic of research in a number of different fields of medicine and public health. As of 2017, several clinical trials continue to gather valuable medical information with respect to the use of bicycling as a form of low-impact exercise for persons with osteoarthritis and as part of a treatment program for obesity. Researchers in the field of public health are studying the rates, risk factors, and distribution of traumatic and overuse injuries related to bicycling, and various approaches for reducing the risk of such injuries.

            <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>

         </div>
         <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
              <br><br>
            Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>

         </div>
         <p class="text">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
      <br><br>
         The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
